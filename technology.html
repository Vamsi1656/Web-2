        <h2>List of New Car Technologies in India</h2>
        <h4>1. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems</h4>
        <img src="./Images/Img-9.jpg">
        <p>Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is an automobile technology that assists drivers in operating their vehicles. These systems use sensors, cameras and complex algorithms to provide drivers with real-time information about their surroundings and warn them of potential hazards. ADAS is designed to help drivers avoid accidents by providing them with early warnings and assistance in emergencies. These systems can also be used to provide drivers with information about the vehicle’s speed, location, and other key parameters. ADAS includes features such as adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection, and automated parking.</p>
        <h4>Here are five things you need to know about ADAS:</h4>
        <li>ADAS includes features such as lane departure warnings and adaptive cruise control, which are designed to make driving safer and more efficient.</li>
        <li>ADAS is not just for high-end luxury vehicles; many mainstream cars now come with some level of ADAS as a standard. This means that these technologies are becoming more accessible to a wider range of drivers.</li>
        <li>While ADAS can be incredibly useful, it’s important to remember that they are not a replacement for a skilled and attentive driver. Drivers still need to pay attention to the road and be aware of their surroundings at all times.</li>
        <li>With ADAS becoming more widespread, we can expect to see a reduction in accidents and fatalities on the road, making driving safer for everyone.</li><br>

        <h2>2. Automatic Emergency Braking</h2>
        <img src="./Images/Img-10.jpg">
        <p>Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) is a safety system that detects potential collisions and automatically applies the brakes to prevent or reduce the severity of an impact. This automobile technology is a derivative of the ADAS and uses a combination of sensors and cameras to monitor the road ahead. It can detect objects such as other vehicles, pedestrians or cyclists. AEB can also be used in combination with other safety features such as forward collision warning and lane departure warning to provide drivers with a comprehensive safety system. With AEB, drivers can have greater confidence in their vehicle’s safety features and can be rest assured that the system will take action to protect them in case of an emergency.</p>
        <h2>3. Connected Mobile Apps/Digital Key</h2>
        <img src="./Images/Img-11.jpg">
        <p>Connected mobile apps and digital keys are changing the way we interact with our vehicles. These apps allow drivers to remotely control and monitor their vehicles using their smartphones. With these apps, drivers can lock and unlock their cars, start the engine, adjust the climate control settings, and even locate their vehicles using GPS. Digital keys, on the other hand, eliminate the need for physical keys. Instead, the digital key is stored on the driver’s smartphone, allowing them to access and start their vehicle without the need for a physical key. This new car technology is particularly useful for car-sharing services and rental companies, as it allows them to provide customers with easy access to their vehicles without the need for a physical key.</p>
        <h2>4. Wireless Smartphone Connectivity and Charging</h2>
        <img src="./Images/Img-12.jpg">
        <p>Wireless smartphone connectivity is another innovative automobile technology that is becoming increasingly popular in modern vehicles. With wireless charging, drivers no longer need to worry about tangled cords or finding the right cable to charge their devices. Instead, they can simply place their smartphone on a wireless charging pad in the car and the device will charge automatically. This technology also allows drivers to easily connect their devices to the car’s infotainment system, enabling them to access their music, contacts and navigation apps without the need for cables or adapters. This technology provides drivers with a seamless and convenient way to stay connected while on the road.4</p>
       <h2>5. 360-Degree Cameras </h2>
       <img src="./Images/Img-13.jpg">
       <p>360 Degree cameras are revolutionising the way drivers view their surroundings. These cameras use multiple lenses to provide drivers with a complete view of their vehicle’s surroundings, including areas that are typically difficult to see. This new car technology can help prevent accidents by providing drivers with a more comprehensive view of their environment. 360-degree cameras are particularly useful when parking, as they provide drivers with a bird’s eye view of their vehicle, making it easier to navigate in tight spaces.</p>
       <h2>6. Blind-Spot View Monitors </h2>
       <img src="./Images/Img-14.jpg">
       <p>Blind-Spot view monitors use cameras and sensors to monitor the vehicle’s blind spots and provide drivers with a warning if there is a vehicle in their blind spot. These monitors are particularly useful when changing lanes or merging onto the highway, as they help drivers avoid collisions by providing them with early warning of potential hazards.</p>
