                    The vintage era lasted from the end of World War I (1918), through to the Wall Street Crash at the end of 1929. During this period the front-engine car came to dominate with closed bodies and standardized controls becoming the norm. In 1919, 90 percent of cars sold were open; by 1929, 90 percent were closed.[12]:Development of the internal combustion engine continued at a rapid pace, with multivalve and overhead camshaft engines produced at the high end, and V8, V12, and even V16 engines conceived for the ultrarich. Also in 1919, hydraulic brakes were invented by Malcolm Loughead (cofounder of Lockheed); they were adopted by Duesenberg for their 1921 Model A.[47]: 62  Three years later, Hermann Rieseler of Vulcan Motor invented the first automatic transmission, which had two-speed planetary gearbox, torque converter, and lockup clutch; it never entered production.[47]: 62  (It would only become an available option in 1940.)[47]: 62  Just at the end of the vintage era, tempered glass (now standard equipment in side windows) was invented in France.[47]: 62  In this era the revolutionary pontoon design of cars without fully articulated fenders, running boards and other noncompact ledge elements was introduced in small series but mass production of such cars was started much later (after WWII).

American auto companies in the 1920s expected they would soon sell six million cars a year but did not do so until 1955. Numerous companies disappeared.[53] Between 1922 and 1925, the number of US passenger car builders decreased from 175 to 70. H. A. Tarantous, managing editor of "MoToR Member Society of Automotive Engineers", in a New York Times article from 1925, suggested many were unable to raise production and cope with falling prices (due to assembly line production), especially for lowpriced cars. The new pyroxylin-based paints, eight-cylinder engine, four-wheel brakes, and balloon tires as the biggest trends for 1925.[54]<br>

Examples of period vehicles:[citation needed]

<li>1922–1939 Austin 7—a widely copied vehicle serving as a template for many cars such as BMW and Nissan.</li>
<li>1922–1931 Lancia Lambda—an advanced car for the time, first car to feature a load-bearing monocoque and independent front suspension.[citation needed]</li>
<li>1924–1929 Bugatti Type 35—one of the most successful racing cars with over 1,000 victories in five years.[citation needed]</li>
<li>1925–1928 Hanomag 2/10 PS—early example of pontoon styling.</li>
<li>1927–1931 Ford Model A (1927–1931)—after keeping the brass era Model T in production for too long, Ford broke from the past by restarting its model series with the 1927 Model A. More than four million were produced, making it the bestselling model of the era. The Ford Model A was a prototype for the beginning of Soviet mass car production (GAZ A).</li>
<li>1930 Cadillac V-16—developed at the height of the vintage era, the V16-powered Cadillac would join Bugatti's Royale as a legendary ultraluxury car of the era.</li>
