            <p style="background-color: chartreuse;">The demand for luxury cars is expected to grow owing to the increasing adoption of smart-connectivity features and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) in luxury cars.

                The COVID-19 outbreak had a negative impact. The demand for luxury cars by dealers and consumers declined significantly due to the lockdown measures imposed across the world.
                
                The COVID-19 along with the semiconductors shortage led to production stoppages and supply bottlenecks throughout the entire automotive industry. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), private vehicle registrations in Europe were contracted by 38.1% year-on-year for the first half of 2020.
                
                According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), worldwide spending on electric vehicles by the consumers and governments experienced a significant rise during 2021 as the spending doubled as compared to 2020, reaching approximately USD 250.0 billion. In 2021, government spending including purchase subsidies and tax exemptions increased to USD 30 billion approximately.</p>

            <p> In 2021, almost 80 million motor vehicles were produced worldwide. This figure translates into an increase of around 3 percent, compared with the previous year. China, Japan, and Germany were the largest producers of cars and commercial vehicles in 2020.
                China leads production
                China is ranked as the largest passenger car manufacturer in the world, having produced more than 21 million cars in 2020, and accounting for almost one third of the world’s passenger vehicle production. Over the past decades, China has emerged as one of the main growth markets for players in the global automobile industry.
                American manufacturers in China
                One of China’s largest car manufacturing companies is the joint venture between General Motors and SAIC Motor Corporation Limited, known as Shanghai General Motors Company Ltd or simply Shanghai GM. GM produces and sells passenger vehicles under the Chevrolet and Cadillac brands, among others. Aside from manufacturing cars, the company also produces engines and transmission systems. Shanghai GM’s 
                production amounted to a little over 1.6 million units in 2019.
